Tuesday is best

Callum - head of blog
James - in charge of scheduling meetings
Luke - main point of contact with client

5 planes of UX
Competitor analysis

Needs from clients:
- Permission to assets
- What is there schedule and boundaries (when shouldn't we bother)
- How often they want to meet (weekly, every two weeks) 
- Deadlines/priority 
- Clarity on brief 
- Data and info from client ASAP

Our understanding of brief:
- Happy with content of the page? 
- Is there a priority on the mobile website or both?
- Donation to be a key concept
- How many user personas and journeys
- Target audience 

Email:
- best time to schedule meeting (11:30+)
- asking for assets (branding, information for personas, info on target audience, any other content they think is important for us to know early on)
- mention main point of contact
-
